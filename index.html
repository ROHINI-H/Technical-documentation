            <p>JavaScript is an object-based scripting language which is lightweight and cross-platform.</p>
            <p>Our JavaScript Tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals both. JavaScript is used to create
                client-side dynamic pages.</p>
            <p>JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming language which is used by several websites
                for
                scripting the webpages. It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming language that enables dynamic
                interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document. It was introduced in the year 1995 for
                adding
                programs to the webpages in the Netscape Navigator browser. Since then, it has been adopted by all other
                graphical web browsers. With JavaScript, users can build modern web applications to interact directly
                without
                reloading the page every time. The traditional website uses js to provide several forms of interactivity
                and
                simplicity.</p>

            <p>A variable is a “named storage” for data. We can use variables to store goodies, visitors, and other
                data.</p>

            <p>To create a variable in JavaScript, use the let, var and const keyword.</p>
            <code><pre>
    let user = 'John', age = 25, message = 'Hello';
    var message = 'Hello';
    const myBirthday = '18.04.1982';</pre></code>
            <p>The JavaScript comments are meaningful way to deliver message. It is used to add information about the
                code,
                warnings or suggestions so that end user can easily interpret the code.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Data_types">
            <header>
                <h2>Data types</h2>
            </header>
            <p>JavaScript provides different data types to hold different types of values. There are two types of data
                types
                in JavaScript.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Primitive data type</li>
                <li>Non-primitive (reference) data type</li>
            </ul>
            <p>JavaScript is a dynamic type language, means you don't need to specify type of the variable because it is
                dynamically used by JavaScript engine. You need to use var here to specify the data type. It can hold
                any type
                of values such as numbers, strings etc.</p>
            <code><pre>
    let billion = 1000000000;
    let single = 'single-quoted';
    let arr = new Array();
    let arr = [];
    let map = new Map();

    map.set('1', 'str1');   // a string key
    map.set(1, 'num1');     // a numeric key
    map.set(true, 'bool1'); // a boolean key</pre>
            </code>

        <section class="main-section" id="Control_flow_statements">
            <header>
                <h2>Control flow statements</h2>
            </header>
            <p>The JavaScript if-else statement is used to execute the code whether condition is true or false. There
                are
                three forms of if statement in JavaScript.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If Statement</li>
                <li>If else statement</li>
                <li>if else if statement</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The JavaScript switch statement is used to execute one code from multiple expressions. It is just like
                else if
                statement that we have learned in previous page. But it is convenient than if..else..if because it can
                be used
                with numbers, characters etc.</p>
            <p>The JavaScript loops are used to iterate the piece of code using for, while, do while or for-in loops. It
                makes
                the code compact. It is mostly used in array.
            <p>

            <p>There are four types of loops in JavaScript.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>for loop</li>
                <li>while loop</li>
                <li>do-while loop</li>
                <li>for-in loop</li>
            </ul>
                <code><pre>
    for (initialization; condition; increment)  
    {  
    code to be executed  
    }</pre>
                </code>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Functions">
            <header>
                <h2>Functions</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Quite often we need to perform a similar action in many places of the script.</p>

            <p>For example, we need to show a nice-looking message when a visitor logs in, logs out and maybe somewhere
                else.
            </p>

            <p>Functions are the main “building blocks” of the program. They allow the code to be called many times
                without
                repetition.</p>

            <p>There are built-in functions, like alert(message), prompt(message, default) and confirm(question). But we
                can
                create functions of our own as well.</p>
            <code><pre>
    function msg(){  
        alert("hello! this is message");  
    }  </pre>
            </code>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Objects">
            <header>
                <h2>Objects</h2>
            </header>
            <p>A javaScript object is an entity having state and behavior (properties and method). For example: car,
                pen,
                bike, chair, glass, keyboard, monitor etc.</p>

            <p>JavaScript is an object-based language. Everything is an object in JavaScript.</p>

            <p>JavaScript is template based not class based. Here, we don't create class to get the object. But, we
                direct
                create objects.</p>
            <p>There are 3 ways to create objects.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>By object literal</li>
                <li>By creating instance of Object directly (using new keyword)</li>
                <li>By using an object constructor (using new keyword)</li>
            </ol>
            <code><pre>
    emp={id:102,name:"Shyam Kumar",salary:40000};  </pre>
            </code>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Events">
            <header>
                <h2>Events</h2>
            </header>
            <p>The change in the state of an object is known as an Event. In html, there are various events which
                represents
                that some activity is performed by the user or by the browser. When javascript code is included in HTML,
                js
                react over these events and allow the execution. This process of reacting over the events is called
                Event
                Handling. Thus, js handles the HTML events via Event Handlers.</p>

            <p>For example, when a user clicks over the browser, add js code, which will execute the task to be
                performed on
                the event.
